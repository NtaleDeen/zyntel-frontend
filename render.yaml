# render.yaml - For zyntel-frontend repository

services:
  - type: static
    name: zyntel-frontend # Name this service in Render dashboard (e.g., "zyntel-frontend")
    # Your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are in the 'public' subfolder.
    # So, the root of this repository is ".", and the publish directory is "public".
    rootDir: . # The root of this repository
    staticPublishPath: public # The subfolder within rootDir that contains your deployable static files
    
    # For a simple HTML/CSS/JS site, no build command is typically needed.
    # If you later use a frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.),
    # you would put your build command here (e.g., "npm install && npm run build")
    # and then adjust staticPublishPath to your build output folder (e.g., "dist" or "build").
    buildCommand: "" # No build command for pure static files
    
    # Enable pull request previews (optional)
